The frozen enemy reduces attack speed, casting speed and movement speed by 10%. If the damage is higher than a certain threshold, the enemy will accumulate ice value. When the ice value exceeds 100 points, the enemy will be frozen. 
Some enemies may have an ice cap of less than 100. 
Each point of freezing point will increase the slowing effect of freezing and the base time of freezing. The ice value is cleared when the freeze state ends." />
